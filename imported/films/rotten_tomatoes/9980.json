The film captures the fantastic journey of Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara), a bright and beautiful young woman who's taken prisoner by a hideous beast (voice of Robby Benson) in his castle. Despite her precarious situation, Belle befriends the castle's enchanted staff-a teapot, a candelabra and a mantel clock, among others-and ultimately learns to see beneath the Beast's exterior to discover the heart and soul of a prince. -- (C) Disney","tag":"Big Nights","slug":"beauty-and-the-beast","critics_score":93,"audience_score":92,"directors":[],"image_m":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jl9FPiw1WORavewfoyeywUDzmI8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/29/11162903_ori.jpg","image_l":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jl9FPiw1WORavewfoyeywUDzmI8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/29/11162903_ori.jpg","rt_link":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beauty_and_the_beast_1991/","region":"auckland","reviews":["44844","0e08a"]}
