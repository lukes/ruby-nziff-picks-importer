{"id":"771372035","title":"God Help the Girl","year":"2014","runtime":111,"synopsis":"In God Help the Girl, writer/director Stuart Murdoch creates a poignant coming-of-age story that doubles as a sublime indie-pop musical from one of indie pop's biggest songwriters. The project began as a suite of songs, written while Murdoch was between records and tours as lead singer of Belle \u0026 Sebastian. He nurtured it for nearly a decade into a fully formed film, set in the bohemian fantasia of Glasgow's West End, which is populated by mods, rockers, and emo kids who have no qualms about breaking into song and dance.
