When the middle-aged, bourgeois Daniel played by Olivier Rabourdi approaches a boyishly handsome Ukrainian who calls himself Marek for a date, he learns the young man is willing to do anything for some cash. What Daniel intends only as sex-for-hire begets a home invasion and then an unexpectedly profound relationship. The drastically different circumstances of the two men's lives reveal hidden facets of the city they share. Presented in four parts, this absorbing, erotically charged drama from writer-director Robin Campillo is centered around anonymous liaisons, in which motivation, risk, and desire produce volatile and unexpected consequences.(C) First Run Features","tag":"Thrill","slug":"eastern-boys","critics_score":90,"audience_score":71,"directors":[],"image_m":"http://resizing.flixster.com/4WhgvrXu9Q017NhDCM-axTtef8E=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/87/11188786_ori.jpg","image_l":"http://resizing.flixster.com/4WhgvrXu9Q017NhDCM-axTtef8E=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/87/11188786_ori.jpg","rt_link":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eastern_boys_2013/","region":"auckland","reviews":["ed5a0","85c97"]}
