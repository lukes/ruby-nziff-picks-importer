With the town lacking the infrastructure to house the overflow of migrants, a local pastor starts the controversial \"overnighters\" program, allowing down-and-out workers a place to sleep at the church. His well-meaning project immediately runs into resistance with his community, forcing the clergyman to make a decision which leads to profound consequences that he never imagined.
