  "synopsis": "From Katy Chevigny (Deadline, Election Day) and Ross Kauffman (Academy Award-winner, Born into Brothels), E-TEAM follows the high-stakes investigative work of four fiercely intrepid human rights workers-Anna Neistat, Ole Solvang, Peter Bouckaert and Fred Abrahams-offering a rare look at their lives at home and dramatic work in the field. As members of the Emergencies Team (or E-Team), a division of a respected, international human rights group, they arrive on the ground soon after allegations of human rights abuses surface, investigating and uncovering crucial evidence in order to document those crimes and capture the world's attention. They also immediately challenge the responsible decision makers, holding them accountable. (C) Neftlix",
