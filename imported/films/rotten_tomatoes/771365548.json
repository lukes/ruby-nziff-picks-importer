  "synopsis": "EXHIBITION depicts a married, middle-aged couple (D and H, respectively played by Viv Albertine and Liam Gillick), both artists, who live in a beautiful modernist house in London's Chelsea. Also designed and built by an artist, the house (i.e. the third character in the film's triangle) is at once a labyrinth, a refuge, a prison and a psychological battleground. As D and H slowly arrive at the painful decision to sell the place, they begin a process of saying goodbye to their shared history under the same roof. (C) Kino Lorber",
