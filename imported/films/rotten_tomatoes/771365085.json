  "synopsis": "Could two American artists have less in common than Sol LeWitt and Llyn Foulkes? Yet both, in their own way, help define what is exciting and cutting-edge in contemporary art. LeWitt (1928-2007) - a notoriously camera-shy, self-effacing, and generous soul - counts among the 20th century's most esteemed conceptual artists. Dutch filmmaker Chris Teerink weaves together rare archival material with footage of the 2011 installation of Wall Drawing #801: Spiral - a glorious white line spiraling down the black wall of a cupola for more than 3 miles. Llyn Foulkes is the West Coast wild man to LeWitt's ascetic East Coast intellectual. Whether talking about his work and life, painting at all hours of the day or night, or making music (he literally is a one-man band), Foulkes embodies the obsessive rebel -- filled with anger, regret, fear, and narcissism - plus a great many hilarious stories about the L.A. art world. His wonderfully macabre paintings and constructions (some incorporating small dead animals) have recently been rediscovered, and his 8-years-in-the-making magnum opus, The Lost Frontier, was purchased by L.A.'s Hammer Museum.
