{"id":"771377010","title":"Pulp: a Film about Life, Death \u0026 Supermarkets","year":"2014","runtime":90,"synopsis":"Florian Habricht's witty, innovative documentary follows the legendary titular band (perhaps the smartest and most charismatic in all of BritPop) as they prepare to say farewell after 25 years of performances. Though culminating with the farewell concert the band played to thousands of adoring fans in their hometown of Sheffield, England, PULP is by no means a traditional concert film or rock doc. As much a testament to the band as it is to the city and inhabitants of Sheffield, PULP weaves exclusive concert footage with man-on-the-street interviews and dreamy staged sequences to paint a picture much larger, funnier, more moving and more life-affirming than any music film of recent memory.
