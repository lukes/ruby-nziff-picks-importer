Disbelieving the official report, Nils soon uncovers evidence of the young man's murder - a victim in a turf war between the local crime boss, known as \"The Count\", and his Serbian rivals. Armed with heavy machinery and a good dose of beginner's luck, Nils embarks upon a quest for revenge that soon escalates into a full-blown underworld gang war, with the body count spiralling ever higher and higher.",
