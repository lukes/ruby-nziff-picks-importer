  "synopsis": "Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival, Point and Shoot chronicles the journey of Matthew VanDyke, a timid 27-year-old who leaves his home in Baltimore and sets off on a self-described \"crash course in manhood\" through the Middle East. The film begins in 2007, when VanDyke, armed with a video camera, embarks on a 35,000-mile motorcycle trip through Northern Africa and the Middle East. While traveling, he strikes up an unlikely friendship with a Libyan hippie, and when revolution breaks out in Libya, Matt joins his friend in the fight against dictator Muammar Gaddafi. With a gun in one hand and a camera in the other, Matt fights in -- and films -- the war until he is captured by Gaddafi forces and held in solitary confinement for six months. Two-time Academy Award nominated documentary filmmaker Marshall Curry (Street Fight, If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front) tells this harrowing and sometimes humorous story of a young man's struggle for political revolution and personal transformation.
