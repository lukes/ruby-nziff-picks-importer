  "synopsis": "The documentary ftells the story of Frank Morgan's life and transformation through interviews with fellow musicians and people who were close to him. These are intercut with footage of Frank, and tracks of his very emotional music. Holding the story together is footage of the preparation and performance of a tribute concert in a prison. The years Frank spent in San Quentin were significant because there were so many great musicians \"in residence\" there that the far-sighted warden of the time allowed them to form a big band, known as The San Quentin All Stars. People came from all around the Bay Area to hear them play.",
