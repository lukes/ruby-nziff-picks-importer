  "synopsis": "Christopher Sullivan's animated dystopia is about as far from a cartoon-for-kids as they come. Relationships among the three main characters - Earl Gray, Gentian Violet, and Victor Blue - multiply and divide as their stories becomes increasingly complex, hilarious, and scary. The Huffington Post writes of the film's \"insanely meticulous construction\" and continues: \"The animation took 15 years of work... The characters were hand-drawn onto layers of glass which were then moved with needles and pins. The film seamlessly combines cutout animation, pencil drawing, collage, and stop-motion animation to create the haunting atmosphere of a self-contained world... (most of whose) characters walk shakily between self-medication and a bad trip... ugly characters (who) make up the most beautiful spectacle you've ever seen.\"",
