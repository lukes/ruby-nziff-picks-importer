  "synopsis": "Middle-aged musician Antoine suddenly decides to end his career. After several days' aimless wandering, he is hired as the caretaker of an old residential building in Paris. Mathilde is a recently retired resident, generous-spirited and deeply involved with the management of the building. After she discovers a crack in her living room wall, her worry gradually turns to panic - what if the building were to collapse? Slowly, Antoine develops a fondness for this woman he is afraid will slip into madness. Through a confusion of misfires and anxiety, the two develop an awkward friendship, funny yet solid, which might just get them through this difficult patch.",
