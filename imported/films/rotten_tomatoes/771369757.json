Aboriginal people live on the threshold of two worlds - one of everyday reality and the other of spirits, demons and entities. They can live an ordinary life with dead ancestors and demons all vying for space. Director Warwick Thornton assembles a collection of poignant, sad, funny and absurd ghost tales from across Australia and brings them to life with some of Australia's most iconic actors as the storytellers. Honest, matter-of-fact firsthand accounts illuminate a black perspective on the other side.","tag":"World","slug":"the-darkside","critics_score":-1,"audience_score":60,"directors":[],"image_m":"http://resizing.flixster.com/DhEwy8AN0XmUZHk9S86oClQ2jiE=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/47/11174756_ori.jpg","image_l":"http://resizing.flixster.com/DhEwy8AN0XmUZHk9S86oClQ2jiE=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/47/11174756_ori.jpg","rt_link":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_darkside/","region":"auckland","reviews":[]}
