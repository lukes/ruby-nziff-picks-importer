  "synopsis": "It's 1983. A naive man with lethal narcotics hidden in his stomach is detained by Australian Federal Police. Alone and afraid, 'the Mule' makes a desperate choice; to defy his bodily functions and withhold the evidence...literally. And by doing so becomes a \"human time-bomb,\" dragging cops, criminals, lawyers and his mother into his impossible escapade. Inspired by true events. (C) XLrator",
