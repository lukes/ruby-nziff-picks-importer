  "synopsis": "Breathtaking, poignant and mesmerizing, MANAKAMANA is a documentary shot entirely inside the narrow bubble of a cable car, high above a jungle in Nepal, as it transports villagers and tourists to an ancient mountaintop temple. Filmed in 16mm and comprised of 11 rides (each a single take corresponds to the length of a roll of film), MANAKAMANA is a tender, ephemeral character study of its passengers and a window onto the lush, rolling landscape of a country in transition from ancient tradition to modernity. This evocative and rigorously structured documentary presents a rich sensory experience that ignites the viewer's imagination to fill in the past, present and future of each moment as they watch. The New York Film Festival calls it, \"...an airborne version of an Andy Warhol screen test...an endlessly suggestive film that both describes and transcends the bounds of time and space.\" (c) Cinema Guild",
