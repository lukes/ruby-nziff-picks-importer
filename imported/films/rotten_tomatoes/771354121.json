  "synopsis": "A good movie gives you a ticket to a secret world and Big Men delivers again and again, taking you into rooms you have no business entering. You'll eavesdrop on meetings about oil deals worth billions of dollars and watch heavily armed militants preparing to strike. It's a fast-paced tour through the high-powered world of African oil deals - a quest for money and power and influence that affects us all. (c) Official Site",
