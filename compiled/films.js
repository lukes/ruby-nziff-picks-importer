Alone in a Paris theater after a long day of auditioning actresses for his new play, writer-director Thomas (Amalric) complains that no actress he's seen has what it takes to play the lead female character: a woman who enters into an agreement with her male counterpart to dominate him as her slave. Thomas is about to leave the theater when actress Vanda (Seigner) bursts in, a whirlwind of erratic - and, it turns out, erotic - energy. At first she seems to embody everything Thomas has been lamenting. She is pushy, foul-mouthed, desperate and ill-prepared - or so it seems. When Thomas finally, reluctantly, agrees to let her try out for the part, he is stunned and captivated by her transformation. Not only is Vanda a perfect fit (even sharing the character's name), but she apparently has researched the role exhaustively, learned her lines by heart and even bought her own props. The likeness proves to be much more than skin-deep. As the extended \"audition\" builds momentum, Thomas moves from attraction to obsession until, with Vanda taking an ever more dominant role, the balance of power shifts completely.

Their motto was: \"Any fate is better than death\". Edgar Reitz's film is a heart-wrenching drama and love story set against the backdrop of this forgotten tragedy. It encompasses a time of tribulation and illuminates the revolutionary and intellectual spirit present in the souls who are center of this tale. Jakob, our protagonist, tries to immerse himself in literature and learning, as the rest of his family toils to fend off starvation. He dreams about leaving his village, Schabbach, for a new life in Brazil and the freedom of the wild South American jungle. He studies the languages of the native South Americans and records his heroic attempts to escape the rural confines of Hunsruck in an astonishing diary that not only tells us his story but reflects the aspirations and philosophies of a whole era. Everyone who encounters Jakob is drawn into the maelstrom of his dreams: his parents, bowed and broken from years of labor making a living from the soil his scheming and brash brother, Gustav and above all Henriette, the fetching daughter of a gem cutter fallen on hard times. Gustav's return from military service is destined to shatter Jakob's world and his love for Henriette, as it symbolizes the necessary rift that will set into motion the unraveling of the regimented family structure. Jakob is not content to allow himself to be stuffed into a mold typical of a young laborer and rebels against his tormentors by assaulting the local marshals in an attempt to stand in solidarity with a fellow revolutionary both are cast into prison and brought near death. For a time Jakob finds a new home after his release, then another, before events beyond his control finally reunite him with his family in Schabbach. It is here that Jakob's colorful and magnetic influence is most strongly realized, and he realizes his place in the world is not that of his dreams. Spectacular landscapes and an ultra-high definition shooting format elevate Edgar Reitz's Home Away From Home from an unforgettable story to a breathtaking cinematic experience.","tag":"Big Nights","slug":"home-from-home-chronicle-of-a-vision","critics_score":-1,"audience_score":94,"directors":[],"image_m":"http://resizing.flixster.com/XnXZ0ZSCRcEFKzeVLbaoxuF-41w=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/00/11190082_ori.jpg","image_l":"http://resizing.flixster.com/XnXZ0ZSCRcEFKzeVLbaoxuF-41w=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/00/11190082_ori.jpg","rt_link":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/home_from_home_chronicle_of_a_vision_2013/","region":"auckland","reviews":[]},{"id":"771361293","title":"The Young and Prodigious T.S.

Dutch filmmaker Chris Teerink weaves together rare archival material with footage of the 2011 installation of Wall Drawing #801: Spiral - a glorious white line spiraling down the black wall of a cupola for more than 3 miles. Llyn Foulkes is the West Coast wild man to LeWitt's ascetic East Coast intellectual. Whether talking about his work and life, painting at all hours of the day or night, or making music (he literally is a one-man band), Foulkes embodies the obsessive rebel -- filled with anger, regret, fear, and narcissism - plus a great many hilarious stories about the L.A. art world. His wonderfully macabre paintings and constructions (some incorporating small dead animals) have recently been rediscovered, and his 8-years-in-the-making magnum opus, The Lost Frontier, was purchased by L.A.'s Hammer Museum.

An extraordinary testament to one man's perseverance, the Sundance award-winning film Watchers of the Sky examines the life and legacy of the Polish-Jewish lawyer and linguist who coined the term genocide. Before Lemkin, the notion of accountability for war crimes was virtually non-existent. After experiencing the barbarity of the Holocaust firsthand, he devoted his life to convincing the international community that there must be legal retribution for mass atrocities targeted at minorities. An impassioned visionary, Lemkin confronted world apathy in a tireless battle for justice, setting the stage for the Nuremberg trails and the creation of the International Criminal Court. Inspired by Samantha Power's Pulitzer Prize-winning book A Problem From Hell, this multi-faceted documentary interweaves Raphael Lemkin's struggle with the courageous efforts of four individuals keeping his legacy alive: Luis Moreno Ocampo, Chief Prosecutor of the ICC; Samantha Power, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; Ben Ferencz, a former Nuremberg prosecutor still tenaciously lobbying the UN for peace, and Rwandan Emmanuel Uwurukundo, UN Refugee Agency Field Director in Chad. Alternating live interviews with rare archival footage and striking animation, Watchers of the Sky illuminates the compassion and bravery of these humanitarians and powerfully demonstrates the ability of global activism to give a voice to the silent victims of genocide.(C) Music Box","tag":"Champions","slug":"watchers-of-the-sky","critics_score":84,"audience_score":80,"directors":[],"image_m":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BpQVHgS2v-nS7DXwb5Srh2Ey4TQ=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/07/11180702_ori.jpg","image_l":"http://resizing.flixster.com/BpQVHgS2v-nS7DXwb5Srh2Ey4TQ=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/07/11180702_ori.jpg","rt_link":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/watchers_of_the_sky/","region":"auckland","reviews":["c6564","98a14"]},{"id":"771371893","title":"The Overnighters","year":"2014","runtime":90,"synopsis":"A modern-day Grapes of Wrath, award-winning documentary The Overnighters is an intimate portrait of job-seekers desperately chasing the broken American Dream to the tiny oil boom town of Williston, North Dakota.

Taking place on the planet Arkanar, which is in the midst of its own Middle Ages, the film focuses on Don Rumata, one of a group of earth scientists who have been sent to Arkanar with the proviso that they must not interfere in the planet's political or historical development.
